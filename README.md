# HealthyScan-App

**HealthyScan** is a mobile application developed as part of a Final Degree Project. Its main goal is to answer the research question:  
*How can an app help improve nutrition by considering an individual's habits and health status?*

The app helps users decide whether supermarket products are suitable for them, taking into account their health conditions and personal habits, aiming to improve nutrition and support overall health and well-being.

## Methodology

- The design and interaction were created to be intuitive, pleasant, and resemble real-life shopping experiences.

## Main Features

- Product recognition using artificial intelligence.  
- Evaluate whether products are suitable according to the userâ€™s health and habits.  
- Additional functionalities to reinforce healthier shopping choices.

## Results
